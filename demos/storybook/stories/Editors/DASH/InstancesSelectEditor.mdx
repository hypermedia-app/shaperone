# InstancesSelectEditor

Similarly to the [enum select](../?path=/docs/dash-enumselecteditor--docs#choice%20of%20iris),
an "instances selector" presents a dropdown, by default populated with instances of a given `sh:class` found in the shapes graph.

<CCallout color="info">
  [Hydra integration library](../?path=/docs/extensions-hydra--docs) can be used to extend the functionality of Instances Select editor so that instance data is dereferenced from external resources.
</CCallout>

<Meta of={InstanceSelect}/>
