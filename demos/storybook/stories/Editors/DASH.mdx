# DASH Forms

<CCallout color="info">
DASH is a recursive acronym which stands for [DASH Data Shapes](http://datashapes.org/)
</CCallout>

DASH is a set of auxiliary specifications by TopQuadrant's SHACL author Holger Knublauch. Specifically, [Form Generation using SHACL and DASH](http://datashapes.org/forms.html) draft is used by Shaperone as a backbone of the form definition.

## Editors

DASH defines two types of editors: `dash:SingleEditor` and `dash:MultiEditor` which represent a user input element of a form.

As the names imply, the former are editors for individual triple object while the latter replaces all values for a given property.

It also provides a set of instances of the `dash:SingleEditor` type. The table below lists them and indicates which are implemented as [matchers](editors/matchers.md) and [components](components/implement.md) by shaperone. Below you will also find some additional information about some of them.
