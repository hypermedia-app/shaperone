# @hydrofoil/shaperone-core

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- e76afd5: Changes to `@hydrofoil/shaperone-wc/configure`:
  - It is now required to call `env.use($rdf)`
  - `editors.addMetadata` now takes a function `(env: ShaperoneEnvironment) => DatasetCore | Iterable<Quad>`

### Patch Changes

- e76afd5: Update RDF/JS-related dependencies (closes #300)
- e76afd5: Use a centralised RDF/JS Environment. Component implementors are encouraged to use the `env` parameter passed to the render function.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bb4047: Use `sh1:orderBy` to define how enum select, instance select and autocomplete should be sorted. The object must be a list of predicates to use for sorting

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- 7ea528e: Add a low-level plugin feature

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- c2e467d: Proper fix for overridden `dash:editor` being lost

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- 01611d5: When an object had default value set, its editor selected in overrides would be changed

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- dff822d: Removed the overload of `forms/addObject` reducer with `nodeKind`/`editor` signature. They must be passed with the `overrides` pointer

## 0.9.15

### Patch Changes

- ef3aa6c: When adding a new form object, it should be possible to pass a pointer with overriding constraints

## 0.9.14

### Patch Changes

- c7b4315: It should be explicitly configurable which editors generate a default node without `sh:defaultValue` property. By default, only `dash:DetailsEditor` does

## 0.9.13

### Patch Changes

- d1be750: When adding a new object for a property, it should is now possible to override the `nodeKind` to
  select
- 680f6dc: When adding a new object for a property, it should is now possible to override the `editor` to select

## 0.9.12

### Patch Changes

- c974b6b: Do not create a new URI when editor is `dash:URIEditor`

## 0.9.11

### Patch Changes

- 79cece9: Prioritise EnumSelect over IRIEditor when there is `sh:in`
- 358db18: Do not create a new node when the editor is a `dash:*SelectEditor`

## 0.9.10

### Patch Changes

- a5b8e3a: Focus node action to clear a selected property

## 0.9.9

### Patch Changes

- 50d4582: One more build fix, where babel tried to compile `.d.ts` files

## 0.9.8

### Patch Changes

- 55271d1: Babel build inadvertently caused TS typings to disappear from packages

## 0.9.7

### Patch Changes

- 683ae4b: When a property has `sh:class` and no `sh:nodeKind`, a blank node should be created for new form values
  This behaviour was inadvertently broken in #236

## 0.9.6

### Patch Changes

- cb60db7: When adding a new value to a property which was `sh:nodeKind sh:IRI`, an empty IRI `<>` was always created, even if it clashed without existing nodes. Now random IRI references will be generated.
  Also, if a property is annotated with `sh1:iriPrefix`, it will be used as base for the created URIs

## 0.9.5

### Patch Changes

- 572a38f: Ensure .js extensions are added to all imports. Previously, there were issues with strict ESM imports

## 0.9.4

### Patch Changes

- 76f55b0: Added a module which exports `sh1` namespace for extensions
- 604a1c0: Export default metadata for multi instances select editor

## 0.9.3

### Patch Changes

- 7eaafd8: Change how `componentState` is accessed in calls to `render`, `init`, etc., which unifies implementations of single
  editors and multi editors.

  Implementors who wish to reuse their code with both kinds of editors, should update their functions so that
  `componentState` is retrieved from the first argument and not from `value` (which does not exist in the case of
  multi editors).

  ```diff
  {
  - init({ value: { componentState } }) {
  - init({ value, componentState }) {
  }
  - render({ value: { componentState } }) {
  + render({ value, componentState }) {
   }
  }
  ```

## 0.9.2

### Patch Changes

- 5099ddc: Potentially breaking: removed `focusOnObjectNode` from multi editor actions since it was not actually passed to
  the implementing code, nor did it make sense anyway.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b8ed7f: Separate `dash:AutoCompleteEditor` with similar functionality so the `dash:InstancesSelectEditor` so that they can be
  implemented as different components more easily

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d6c3b4: Significant changes in handling translations:

  - `Item` interface is removed. All translations should be directly retrieved from `GraphPointer`
    objects wherever needed
  - `languages` property removed from `FormSetting`. Instead, the current display language(s) are
    sourced from `@rdfjs-elements/lit-helpers`. `navigator.languages` by default
  - `label` function removed from interface of `dash:EnumSelectEditor` and
    `dash:InstancesSelectEditor` since they will be dynamically rendered using the
    `@rdfjs-elements/lit-helpers/localizedLabel.js` directive

## 0.8.8

### Patch Changes

- 61ac785: Update `@tpluscode/rdf-ns-builders` to v2
- bc6a5d6: Default value would have incorrectly used `xsd:langString` instead of `rdf:langString` to fill the form
- bc6a5d6: `TextAreaWithLangEditor` wrongly matched on `rdf:string` instead of `xsd:string`
